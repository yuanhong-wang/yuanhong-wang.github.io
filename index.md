## About Me

Greetings! I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Beihang University.
My main research interests lie in relational statistic learning theory and graph mining, designing and analyzing machine learning algorithms for structure data from both          theoretical and practice aspects.
I also have some experiences about building deep learning framework and benchmarking its performace.
I am supervised by [Juhua Pu](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1183/8281.htm).
I am lucky to collaborate with [Yuyi Wang](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/yuwang) and [Ondřej Kuželka](https://ida.fel.cvut.cz/~kuzelka/).

I received my master's degree in Computer Science at Beihang University and bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Beijing Jiaotong University.
I was an SDE with Microsoft at Beijing before enrolling in the Ph.D. program.
