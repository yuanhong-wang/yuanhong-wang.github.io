## About Me

Greetings! I am an Assistant Professor with the School of Artificial Intelligence at [Jilin University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jilin_University).
My research interests lie in broad areas of Artificial Intelligence, including Statistical Relational Learning, Lifted Model Counting and Sampling, Neurosymbolic AI.
I am enthusiastic about developing efficient algorithms for probabilistic inference, learning and samples generation in **relational domains**.
My current research focuses on:

- **Efficient Inference and Sampling in Relational Domains:** lifted reasoning, lifted sampling, and their applications
- **AI for combinatorics:** graph polynomials, model counting, and their connections with AI

I obtained my Ph.D. degree and master degree in Computer Science both at Beihang University supervised by [Juhua Pu](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1183/8281.htm).
I received bachelor degree in Mathematics at Beijing Jiaotong University.
I am lucky to collaborate with [Yuyi Wang](https://disco.ethz.ch/members/yuwang) and [Ondřej Kuželka](https://ida.fel.cvut.cz/~kuzelka/).

📢 **招收2025年硕士（1名）和博士研究生（1名），欢迎对以上研究方向感兴趣的同学通过邮件联系我，邮件中请注明研究兴趣并附上简历。**
